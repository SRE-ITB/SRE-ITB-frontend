Currently, he is working as a process engineer at TRIPATRA. So, what is a process engineer and what does one need to prepare to become a process engineer? \n\nAfter graduating from ITB, he started his professional career as a process engineer at KIS Group, a multinational EPC Company focusing on engineering and construction of biogas technology. Then he worked at BECIS, a multinational Energy as a Service (EaaS) company which focused on biomass energy plants as a senior feasibility engineer. And now he works as a process engineer in the Green Energy Directorate at TRIPATRA, which focuses on developing new sectors of the green energy business case. \n\nProcess engineers generally work to design, implement and optimize chemical & biochemical processes by process simulation, calculation, etc. In the Green Energy Directorate, Eko handles some projects related to sustainable green energy that have commercial feasibility to be developed such as biomass, biogas, waste heat recovery, green hydrogen, etc. In his daily work, Eko performs technical and commercial review of green energy projects, collecting technical data, communicating with vendors about proposals and quotations, doing technical clarification, until getting commercial numbers of the project to be simulated into a financial model which are then compiled into a report as a reference to make final decisions on whether to go or no-go projects. With the team, he also explores new green energy technology cases which are worth developing in the near future starting from analyzing potential technology, collecting the technology provider, and making a communication with them until the project comes and matures enough to be developed and executed further. \n\nRegarding recruitment paths, especially for fresh graduates, there are generally 2 paths: Management Trainee (MT) and Normal Path. Both have fairly similar processes, from CV screening, psychological tests, HR and User Interviews, medical check-ups, and offering. In the normal path, the position and department are clear from the beginning, while for MT, there is usually training and applicants will be rotated through various department positions and assigned to several projects until the final stage where applicants will be offered a position in a department. It should be noted that the MT mechanism in each company is different; for TRIPATRA, the MT process takes about 2 years. \n\nFinally, some tips from Eko: he believes that career readiness has to be prepared when you're still in college. He strongly advises students to gain more experience and connections during college, especially in activities like competitions, internships, student organizations, etc. He also recommends students to maintain their academic grades as high as possible since in many big companies, there is usually a minimum GPA requirement as per their standard. For the interview stage, we need to research the company, prepare the strategy, and be ourselves when answering questions. Some specific skills that can increase the added value of the process engineer are computer literacy, for example, data analytics, data visualization, pitching skills, and the most important thing is being capable of using some process simulation software. For fundamental science and engineering knowledge, generally it was already covered through the course in college. But in reality, sometimes we have to face new things that we haven't learnt before in college. So, we have to be more agile and curious to learn new things. In the professional world, everything is always integrated. There is no single knowledge that stands alone, it is always interdisciplinary knowledge and team collaboration."},{image:h,source:"Fatima Ulya Salmiya",position:"Ex-Technical Support Engineer at Schneider Electric",paragraph:"Ms. Fatima graduated from Power Engineering program at Institut Teknologi Bandung. Before joining Schneider Electric, Ms. Fatima worked as an Electrical Engineer at Syntek Energy and Control. More information can be found here (https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatimaulyas/). She is currently switching track from engineering to sales. So, what exactly is a Technical Support Engineer? How to be a Schneider Electric employee?\n\n Ms. Fatima has been pursuing a career in engineering since her internship. Knowing that Schneider Electric existed, she attempted to apply.

Moreover, PM need to be able to work nearly 24 hours a day for coordinations & monitoring the project in order to operate in the Asian market, which presents time zone differences. In addition, having numerous senior teams necessitates that PM maintains both direct and online leadership abilities too. \n\nIrfan Adiyanto thought that at GE, everyone was highly professional and that the company's culture of openness was exceptional. Since GE is a multi-company, time is valuable due to its higher productivity rate. GE prioritises quality over quantity in order to create further growth opportunities. \n\nIrfan Adiyanto believes that We dont always get the job you want, you shouldn't be worry. Just focus what you have and keep developing yourself,Complaining won't help us; instead, look for internal networking opportunities and have a positive attitude at all times. And believe your moment will come. Irfan Adiyanto felt the need to implement a growth mindset , be flexible, humble & transparent. Since starting work at GE, everyone has put in a lot of effort and taken their own portion. Understanding the surroundings is necessary to keep growing. Determine your way of exploring, assess yourself, and set a goal."},{image:d,source:"Vincentius Adven Brilian",position:"Geothermal Engineering Consultant",paragraph:'The scorching heat of the Earth’s interior, pipes sprouting out of the ground like worms after a rainy day, and the white steam rising like a cloud plume are not the images that many people think of when they hear the phrase "Mechanical Engineering Graduate Entry Jobs". Vincentius Adven Brilian, also known as Adven or Mas Adven, graduated from Mechanical Engineering UGM in 2023 and has managed to establish himself as an example of a mechanical engineering graduate working in the geothermal energy industry, which graduates of geoscience and mining-petroleum engineering primarily occupy. Adven is currently working as a Geothermal Production Engineer at PT Geoenergis Indonesia. \n\nAlthough it was not a typical career route for a mechanical engineering graduate, he had been planning to become a geothermal engineer for a long time. It arose from his interest in the geothermal field, which had expanded from his first year of college through multiple competitions. However, Adven stated that when preparing for a career as a geothermal engineer, especially within the reservoir and production subsector, he noticed that there was a knowledge gap between this line of work and the mechanical engineering curriculum he had studied in college. To bridge this gap, Adven often conducts learning activities outside of lectures. He routinely participated in geothermal engineering project competitions and webinars, which allowed him to improve and hone his talents in this area. He also studied independently using textbooks and online resources to validate the results he obtained from hands-on learning in competitions. \n\nSo, what exactly is geothermal engineering? Geothermal engineering is the use of technology and engineering sciences to harness natural Earth\'s heat. Geothermal engineering is classified into three sub sectors: reservoir, production, and power plant. Geothermal reservoir engineering sub-sector focuses on the determination of well locations and continues with several measurements within the wellbore. Meanwhile, geothermal production engineering is responsible for connecting reservoirs and power plants, as well as dealing with surface piping. Finally, the power plant sub-sector handles energy generation from geothermal energy using a variety of thermodynamically viable processes. This industry also employs many supporting engineers, including electrical engineers, civil engineers, and chemical engineers. \n\nAmong these three sub sectors, Adven chose to work on the production subsector. He feels that the reservoir and production subsectors offer numerous development potentials that can be exploited. In essence, the "playground" for these two sub sectors is extremely broad, compared to the power plant sub sector where most of the technology has already matured. Adven also considers this because he is interested in research and development. \n\nAs a consulting company, Geoenergis provides solutions to its clients around the topics of, but not limited to, geothermal geoscience surveys and well targeting, resource assessment and feasibility study, exploration strategy, due diligence, geothermal education for local community and public, reservoir engineering and modelling, environmental and social study for geothermal study, field development strategy, drilling and workover. The solutions are provided in the form of recommendation reports, while the execution of the recommendations remain on the hand of the client as the geothermal field or power plant owner. Even so, Adven explained that the work he does is still quite similar to that of a geothermal engineer at an operator company. Apart from that, working at the consulting company provides flexibility in time and place, working can be done from anywhere, so it will be easier to complete assignments. \n\nThe ability to use versatile software, such as Microsoft Office, which is necessary for creating reports and presentations, is undoubtedly the most crucial hard skill. Aside from that, mastery of Reservoir Simulation Software is equally vital in the reservoir sector. Regarding soft skills, Adven believes that effective communication skills is a critical ability for teamwork. He underlined that as their coworkers and clients come from a variety of backgrounds, they need to be masters at interpreting context and adjusting language in presentations. To bridge the knowledge and skill gaps, particularly in hard skills, Adven enrolled in numerous training courses (online courses). Adven also attends several seminars on topics pertinent to his profession. \n\nAdven went through a recruitment process that can be deemed to be unusual. He got admitted at Geoenergis through talent scouting. This was strongly tied to his active participation in geothermal project competitions during his university years, which brought him into contact with a recruiter who was a judge at the time. Adven\'s participation in the competition produced high-quality outcomes that have already met industry requirements. From his experience, Adven realized that competitions and international conferences could serve as a platform to showcase one’s expertise and promote them to a larger audience.'},{image:u,source:"Sabrina Rahmi Adiyar",position:"Process Engineer at Cargill",paragraph:"Sabrina Rahmi Adiyar is a chemical engineering graduate from Diponegoro University.

Since the beginning of her career as a chemical engineer, her passion has been directed towards the manufacturing industry. Before graduating, she gained experience working as a quality intern at GE Power and Unilever. Wanting to fulfill her passion and maximize the knowledge she gained in her major, Sabrina then explored opportunities in the manufacturing industry. Cargill Company is a perfect fit for her that she now works as a process engineer in the manufacturing technology department there. \n\nRather than calling it work-life balance, Sabrina prefers to see the concept as ‘work-life juggling’, as it requires effort to balance both elements. Based on her experience, work-life juggling is more challenging during the adaptation phase when starting a new role, as she switched from quality department to manufacturing. One of the challenges is the knowledge gap with seniors. Many technical outcomes can be learned in actual work, that also requires extra effort to be understood, especially when working with colleagues in a global, multilingual environment. Additionally, adapting to the work culture also takes time. Once able to adapt to these two aspects, work-life juggling becomes easier. \n\nSabrina found the job opening at Cargill through LinkedIn before graduating in April. For the role of process engineer, the necessary document screening is the CV. If successful at this stage, a user interview agenda is scheduled, including interviews with the prospective manager and the plant director. The recruitment process takes about three weeks. \n\nAs a fresh graduate, having bargaining power is important when looking for a job. Achieving the company's desired goals will help to stand out during the selection process. Due to the need for technical understanding, Sabrina's role tends to prioritize talents with work experience, making her two previous experiences as quality intern her bargaining power. Effectively showcasing bargaining power is also crucial in negotiating salary as it demonstrates the worth of one's experience. Furthermore, maintaining a GPA within a safe range is sufficient to show our responsibility during the study. \n\nAs she thrives her career in engineering, Sabrina hopes she could convey these two principles earlier: expanding her network as soon as possible to be exposed better into collaboration with stakeholders in the industry; and maintaining a growth mindset as to not be discouraged by academic failures, since chances to explore better exist in work. Therefore, Sabrina strongly encourages her peers not to dwell too much on failures or be satisfied with success while in the process of progress."},{image:p,source:"Carry Kharisma",position:"Vehicle Evaluator & Technical Li-battery Activation Engineer at PT HLI Green Power",paragraph:"Carry Kharisma, also known as Pak Carry, began his academic path at Astra Polytechnic (formerly Polman Astra), where he got an associate's degree (eq. to D3) in automotive engineering technology. Inspired by several career-related motivations and pursuits of engineering, he opted to continue his studies by earning a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at the highly prestigious University of Indonesia. His dedication and hard work paid off in 2012 when he finally graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering. \n\nCarry's vocational education at Astra Polytechnic significantly enhanced his practical and technical skills, providing him with a solid foundation for his early career as an RnD-Testing Foreman at Astra. The curriculum's strong emphasis on hands-on learning and technical training, including numerous Kuliah Kerja (work internships), gave him invaluable real-world experience that traditional colleges often lack. This practical focus not only honed his technical abilities but also gave him a competitive edge in his early career at Astra, allowing him to excel and advance rapidly within the company. \n\nAt HLI Green Power, Carry's role involves overseeing the optimization of production processes. His tasks include conducting trials to enhance machine performance, collaborating with the central R&D team in Korea on design improvements, and assessing new machinery to ensure they meet production requirements. He notes that only about 10% of his mechanical engineering knowledge from UI applies directly, while much of the relevant knowledge comes from chemical engineering and electrical engineering. \n\nRecognizing cultural differences is key, as shown by Carry's shift from a Japanese to a Korean company.

Despite still being a student, he has accumulated three years of experience working as a Junior Engineer at ALIMA and freelancing as a Reservoir Engineering and Blockchain Technology Consultant. He has also worked as a Lead Scientist at Supreme Energy (third party) and Engineer at LAPI. Presently, Mesias is a Reservoir Engineer at Pertamina Energy. \n\nMesias began by explaining how the COVID-19 pandemic affected his life. As he was about to graduate, he missed the graduation euphoria and had to find ways to work while studying. This situation led him into Software Engineering. Through a connection with HIMPI Patra, he got the opportunity to work as a consultant in website development. He was later invited to work as a CTO in a blockchain company founded by a Patra alumnus. This experience enabled him to learn a lot about programming, which eventually led him to the energy and geothermal sector. \n\nAlthough initially unfamiliar with geothermal, Mesias started learning about it during his time at ALIMA, which motivated him to delve deeper into the field. In his sixth semester, he decided to join the fast-track program for geothermal studies. His dedication to learning geothermal made him a go-to person in the field. The knowledge and experience he gained led to his acceptance at Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) through a rigorous recruitment process. \n\nMesias explained that there are two pathways to joining state-owned enterprises (BUMN), through a joint recruitment process or contract recruitment usually initiated by HR. He detailed that the recruitment process at PGE involves strict administrative selection, CV screening, and interviews. As a Reservoir Engineer, his tasks include monitoring wellhead conditions, conducting reservoir simulations, and planning drilling operations. \n\nSince getting acquainted with AE 5, Mesias has often studied geothermal tools and conditions. He also reads papers to expand his knowledge, believing that participating in competitions is very helpful for applying the knowledge learned in class. His experiences in competitions like APEX UGM, API, and various other contests helped him develop connections and practical knowledge. \n\nDespite working in Gambir while living in Bekasi, Mesias feels happy with the friendly work environment at PGE. He receives ample support for continuous learning and has opportunities to become a permanent employee. Although the challenge of salary and living costs in Jakarta is significant, the fieldwork experience and knowledge gained are invaluable. \n\nMesias emphasizes the importance of not limiting oneself. He encourages students to learn broadly and seek opportunities in various fields. He also highlights the importance of finding mentors and not being overly confident, as there is always more to learn from others. According to Mesias, geothermal in Indonesia is advancing both academically and industrially. Many companies are interested in innovations and research in this field. Operators need to understand the outputs of consultants and academics to maximize geothermal potential."}]}),(0,a.jsx)(s.Z,{})]})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[189,217,763,774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=377)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);

      paragraph: 'Putra Adhiguna and his colleague established the Energy Shift Institute as an energy research institution focusing on East and Southeast Asia’s energy transition, including Indonesia. They explore the shifting patterns, levers of changes and challenges in energy transition. Energy Shift produces thought leadership publications for stakeholders such as investors and policymakers. \n\nThe technical nature of the energy transition often requires a nuanced understanding of how investors, corporations and governments behave. Energy Shift positions itself as a credible information provider to spark conversations which are often too sensitive for existing stakeholders to raise, yet too technical for the climate movement to address. \n\nOne of the differences between a think tank and a consultant typically lies in the non-profit nature of a think tank which can allow it to better maintain independence. Energy Shift operates as a non-profit institution with the primary goal of preserving its independence in providing evidence-based analyses on the energy transition. \n\nWith a strong background in oil, gas and geothermal energy, Putra Adhiguna transitioned to the non-profit sector. He sees the need for a better understanding of Indonesia\'s energy direction, particularly in the context of the global energy transition. While transitioning from the commercial sector to the non-profit sector is not too common, Putra believes that think tanks can play a strategic role in providing insights and shaping an informed public discourse. \n\nThe Energy Shift Institute provides views for financial institutions investing in the energy sector, helping to distinguish between promising opportunities and the ‘gimmicks’. Greenwashing remains a large risk in the Southeast Asian region given the wide information asymmetry between the public, government and private sector. \n\nIn choosing a career in a think tank, it is important to consider the need for a combination of practical experience and theoretical understanding. Think tanks also require individuals with a strong interest in change and progress in public discourse. \n\nEnergy Shift Institute typically seeks individuals with 3-5 years of relevant work experience in energy or finance to join them. Think tanks like the Energy Shift Institute play a crucial role in shaping public discourse and providing different perspectives on energy transition. \n\nThink tanks revenue typically rely on the various funding institutions which they collaborate with. Non-profit institutions are not too well suited for individuals who seek rapid income growth but can provide a strong learning platform while making impactful works. However, as young professionals progress in becoming an expert in their fields, opportunities for career and income development will naturally come by, whether within the non-profit sector or outside. \n\nEnergy Shift Institute emerges as a key entity supporting sustainable energy transition in East and Southeast Asia. It seeks to push the envelope of understanding the energy transition opportunities and risks for investors, policymakers and the public alike.'

      position: 'Team Leader business Development and strategic partnership at PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur',
      paragraph: 'Mr Fakhrul Aufa graduated from IPB with a bachelor\'s degree and UI with a master\'s degree  in finance. His track record in finance can be tracked from June 2011 as the head of Research  and Market Information at IBPA Indonesia Stock Exchange. He is currently working as a Team  Leader in business Development and Strategic Partnership at PT Sarana Multi Infrastructure.  We can see his experience in finance from his studies to his workplace, so are you interested  in finance or do you want to know how to be like Fakhrul Aufa? \n\nMr Fakrul always pursuing his studies in finance. At IPB he was studying macro-finance and  cost analysis. He said that finance (especially in construction) is about cost feasibility. It is  important since a lot of projects or technological advancements often forget about costs and  installation or manufacturing. If you want to learn more about finance but not in that faculty,  you can take a subject about cost and management feasibility in your study program. \n\nPT Sarana Multi Infrastructure (SMI) itself is a state-owned company (BUMN) that connects the government to contractors in building infrastructure or doing a government policy. You can  think of it as a government representative that manages the money to build government  infrastructure. As a finance specialist, his work in SMI consists of two things, first involving a  money lending plan and second consisting of monitoring. In the money lending plan, his work  involves preparing documents about the scale of projects, environmental control, licensing,  and so on. After that, the work consists of surveying the site of construction, whether is it as it  says on the document, whether is it feasible, and checking many others. The conclusion from  the document and survey will be made in the report, and with that, it will be decided if the  projects will be funded or not by the government. \n\nFor those who are interested in PT SMI, Mr Fakhrul says it’s not about money or finances  alone. You can join SMI even though you are not from finance. Because if you want a project  to be done, you must discuss it with other people who have different abilities and perspectives.  Although as we stated before that base knowledge about money management is a must. You  can learn it from your daily life activity. For example, for living costs and for doing a campus  activity, you still need to manage the money that you have. Because modern society runs  around money, cost management is not separate from our lives. \n\nBack to Mr Fakhrul, if you want to join PT SMI you can try it first in apprenticeship. PT SMI are  opening an apprenticeship program every year that opens on LinkedIn or a website. The  division for your apprenticeship itself is not about money, it depends on the needs of the  company. The benefit of an apprenticeship program is not just learning in work but you can  also be paid depending on your work, so it is pretty good. But if you are ready to join you can  register with the company usually through HR calls or the website. For now, PT SMI is still  recruiting experienced workers (around 2-3 years of work experience) because of job requirements. So it still rarely recruits fresh graduates. But you can still be joining the  apprenticeship program. \n\nFor those who are still nervous or uncertain about joining or not. Mr Fakhrul has good news  for you. because it is a state-owned company, the future and work balance are standardized  by the government just like other state-owned companies. For salary itself, you can get 15  times payments per year including holiday allowance and daily allowances like transportation  and uniform (Batik and formal wear). For other allowances depending on the year, you can  get around 5 – 7 times your normal salary. Another benefit of joining PT SMI is you get help to  get a home loan. So your daily life and future is secured. \n\nSo are you interested in Finance? Or do you want to be like Mr Fakhrul who gets success in  a finance company? Or you are interested in joining PT SMI? Whatever your choice is, you  cannot work alone, just like the other every person has different abilities. For us to solve the  problem we need to we need to work together to come up with a resolution.'

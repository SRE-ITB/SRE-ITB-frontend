      position: 'Indonesia Hub Execution Centre Leader at Schneider Electric',
      paragraph: 'Maringan Cipto Budi Handoyo, affectionately known as Maringan, began his career journey at CEGELEC Indonesia as a Project Engineer and Electrical Engineer simultaneously, which helped him carve out his future career path. Looking back, Maringan envisioned a career in project management, leveraging the expertise he had cultivated.\n\n Eventually, he seized an opportunity to work as a Techno-Commercial Engineer at Schneider Electric, responsible for tendering and project execution activities. Continuing his development, Maringan was entrusted with the role of Export Project Management Lead for a year before transitioning to domestic management. In 2021, he was appointed to an operational position as the Sustainability & SERE (Safety, Environment, and Real Estate) Manager, expanding his expertise in the sustainability field. \n\nAfter a couple of years, he gained the trust to lead the Indonesia Hub Execution Center, where he oversees a wider scope encompassing tendering, project management, and engineering project solution activities. According to him, a Project Manager\'s role is to ensure all stakeholders\' functions run efficiently and accurately, bringing together a series of links to achieve the same aim. A Project Manager must be capable of managing the scope of work, time, budget, and resources.\n\n Maringan believes that becoming a Project Manager necessitates several skills. Engineering hard skills in each scientific discipline must be mastered, and he even enrolled in a Primavera certification course to pursue his career as a Project Manager. \n\nIn addition to literacy skills, life and career skills such as adaptation, initiative, cultural skills, productivity, accountability, and leadership are required. The second category is learning and innovation, which includes problem-solving, communication, creativity, cooperation, and critical thinking. Soft skills, particularly in communication, play a crucial role. How a candidate explains, describes, analyzes, and plans impacts will demonstrate their potential as a great Project Manager or highlight areas for further development. \n\nIn an era where business transformation strategies are rapidly changing, having more talent is crucial. Companies look for individuals who collaborate effectively and are open to new challenges. Maringan’s career shifts have led him to expand his comfort zone rather than simply move on. To him, embracing the challenge and achieving something worthwhile is appreciated and brings significant value.\n\n In addition to formal education and hard skills, personal attitudes and soft skills are also crucial. Mental development is essential and as we develop, our lives change. It\'s natural to feel intimidated, but perseverance is key. "Making mistakes is part of the learning process, and pushing oneself beyond the comfort zone is vital for growth," adds Maringan. \n\nAs Maringan reflects on his career journey, he is also reminded of his candidacy journey when he applied to Schneider Electric. Generally, applicants seeking to work at Schneider must undergo several interview steps. The first round involves a Talent Acquisition interview, which includes questions on Schneider Company Values and the applicants\' work motivation. This is followed by a user interview assessing applicants based on their experiences and skills relative to the requirements. The interview aims to determine the applicant\'s developmental potential, eagerness to learn, willingness to go above and beyond, and understanding of a scientific discipline. In some cases, a general ability test will be conducted. If successful, applicants will be required to undergo a medical checkup and additional reference checks. \n\n"My top tip to anyone seeking to join this longstanding global company is to show that you’re driven by the spirit to make an impact and contribute to the business, people, and our environment," ends Maringan. \n\nOverall, Maringan Cipto\'s journey demonstrates the importance of being curious to master different fields, exhibiting perseverance in achieving career success, and staying committed to a bigger purpose.'

      position: 'Process Engineer at Green Energy TRIPATRA',
      paragraph: 'Eko Fitrianto is a graduate of Bioengineering ITB in 2014. Currently, he is working as a process engineer at TRIPATRA. So, what is a process engineer and what does one need to prepare to become a process engineer? \n\nAfter graduating from ITB, he started his professional career as a process engineer at KIS Group, a multinational EPC Company focusing on engineering and construction of biogas technology. Then he worked at BECIS, a multinational Energy as a Service (EaaS) company which focused on biomass energy plants as a senior feasibility engineer. And now he works as a process engineer in the Green Energy Directorate at TRIPATRA, which focuses on developing new sectors of the green energy business case. \n\nProcess engineers generally work to design, implement and optimize chemical & biochemical processes by process simulation, calculation, etc. In the Green Energy Directorate, Eko handles some projects related to sustainable green energy that have commercial feasibility to be developed such as biomass, biogas, waste heat recovery, green hydrogen, etc. In his daily work, Eko performs technical and commercial review of green energy projects, collecting technical data, communicating with vendors about proposals and quotations, doing technical clarification, until getting commercial numbers of the project to be simulated into a financial model which are then compiled into a report as a reference to make final decisions on whether to go or no-go projects. With the team, he also explores new green energy technology cases which are worth developing in the near future starting from analyzing potential technology, collecting the technology provider, and making a communication with them until the project comes and matures enough to be developed and executed further. \n\nRegarding recruitment paths, especially for fresh graduates, there are generally 2 paths: Management Trainee (MT) and Normal Path. Both have fairly similar processes, from CV screening, psychological tests, HR and User Interviews, medical check-ups, and offering. In the normal path, the position and department are clear from the beginning, while for MT, there is usually training and applicants will be rotated through various department positions and assigned to several projects until the final stage where applicants will be offered a position in a department. It should be noted that the MT mechanism in each company is different; for TRIPATRA, the MT process takes about 2 years. \n\nFinally, some tips from Eko: he believes that career readiness has to be prepared when you\'re still in college. He strongly advises students to gain more experience and connections during college, especially in activities like competitions, internships, student organizations, etc. He also recommends students to maintain their academic grades as high as possible since in many big companies, there is usually a minimum GPA requirement as per their standard. For the interview stage, we need to research the company, prepare the strategy, and be ourselves when answering questions. Some specific skills that can increase the added value of the process engineer are computer literacy, for example, data analytics, data visualization, pitching skills, and the most important thing is being capable of using some process simulation software. For fundamental science and engineering knowledge, generally it was already covered through the course in college. But in reality, sometimes we have to face new things that we haven\'t learnt before in college. So, we have to be more agile and curious to learn new things. In the professional world, everything is always integrated. There is no single knowledge that stands alone, it is always interdisciplinary knowledge and team collaboration.'
